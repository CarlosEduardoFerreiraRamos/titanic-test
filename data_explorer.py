1.Variable Identification

segregate varibles in: 
    *Type of varible: predictor or target variable;
    *Data type: Character or numeric;
    *Varible category: categorical or continuos.
"""

"""
2.Univariate Analysis
At this stage, we explore variables one by one. Method to perform uni-variate analysis will
depend on whether the variable type is categorical or continuous.
    Continuous Variables:- In case of continuous variables, we need to understand the central
    tendency and spread of the variable.
    Central tendency - Measure of Dispersion - Visualization Method
    Mean               Range                   Histogram
    Median             Quartile                Box plot
    Mode               IQR
    Min                Standerd Variation
                       Skewness and Kurtosis

    Categorical Variables:- For categorical variables, weâ€™ll use frequency table to understand
    distribution of each category. We can also read as percentage of values under each category.
"""

"""
3.Bi-variate Analysis
Bi-variate Analysis finds out the relationship between two variables. Here, we look for association
and disassociation between variables at a pre-defined significance level. We can perform bi-variate
analysis for any combination of categorical and continuous variables. The combination can be:
Categorical & Categorical, Categorical & Continuous and Continuous & Continuous. Different methods
are used to tackle these combinations during analysis process.
