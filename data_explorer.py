1.Variable Identification

segregate varibles in: 
    *Type of varible: predictor or target variable;
    *Data type: Character or numeric;
    *Varible category: categorical or continuos.
"""

2.Univariate Analysis
At this stage, we explore variables one by one. Method to perform uni-variate analysis will
depend on whether the variable type is categorical or continuous.
    Continuous Variables:- In case of continuous variables, we need to understand the central
    tendency and spread of the variable.
    Central tendency - Measure of Dispersion - Visualization Method
    Mean               Range                   Histogram
    Median             Quartile                Box plot
    Mode               IQR
    Min                Standerd Variation
                       Skewness and Kurtosis

    Categorical Variables:- For categorical variables, weâ€™ll use frequency table to understand
    distribution of each category. We can also read as percentage of values under each category.

3.Bi-variate Analysis
Bi-variate Analysis finds out the relationship between two variables. Here, we look for association
and disassociation between variables at a pre-defined significance level. We can perform bi-variate
analysis for any combination of categorical and continuous variables. The combination can be:
Categorical & Categorical, Categorical & Continuous and Continuous & Continuous. Different methods
are used to tackle these combinations during analysis process.

    *Continuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we
    should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables.
    The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can
    be linear or non-linear.
        - Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength
          of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation.
          Correlation varies between -1 and +1.

            -1: perfect negative linear correlation;
            +1:perfect positive linear correlation and 
            0: No correlation

        Correlation can be derived using following formula:
        Correlation = Covariance(X,Y) / SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))
    
    *Categorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables,
    we can use following methods:
        - Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and
          count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories
          of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of
          row and column categories.

        - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table.

        - Chi-Square Test: stoped here
